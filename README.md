# Mediator
Python-based mediator to translate sparql-queries from one ontology into another, based on an EDOAL alignment.

This project is to result in a proof-of-concept in support of my PhD dissertation about the realisation of semantic interoperability. 

Do not hesitate to get in contact with me.
